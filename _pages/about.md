Hey, this is Hardik! Welcome to my website. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering with minor in Machine Learning from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

I am deeply interested in Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning and its application in Language Models. I am currently working with [Prof. Sayak Ray Chowdhury](https://sites.google.com/view/sayakraychowdhury/home) on Vision Language Models (VLMs). I have previously worked with [Prof. Soumya Dutta](https://soumyadutta-cse.github.io/research/) on Autoendcoders and Diffusion Models.

Apart from academics, I love buidling stuff and I am quite active in the open source community, having contributions in various open source projects. I also enjoy music and football and I am a big fan of FC Barcelona.
